Hello stranger, _welcome_. I guess some introductions would be in order. As the site says, my name is Jaime Travesedo, though I also use Arzdou in the interwebz. I am young-ish PhD student, at least at the time of writting this, in the field of quantum physics. I won't bore you with the details just yet, I might save it for another post, suffice to say, I try to make some sort of quantum computer while failing spectacularly.

Look! Here I am, happy and naive at the beggining of my PhD:

And look! Here I am again, a year and a half later, still happy, but with a moustache that any self-respecting art/literature teacher would tell you to interpret as a sign of depression and gradual loss of self-respect... But don't listen to _them_! Look at the **smile**

In any case, I also enjoy doing other stuff. I have always liked videogames and reading, so you can probably expect some posts here to deal with games I have played or books I have read. I enjoy coding activities and programming in general, so maybe I will write some stuff too. I love motorbikes and diving so probably I will add pictures of small travel journals. I don't know! And I think that is what makes it fun :). 

See you later space cowboy.
